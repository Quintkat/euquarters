      <h1>Card legality details</h1>
      
      <h2>Why does this have its own page?</h2>
      <p>
        I think it's important for the process of deciding when a card is legal to be transparent.<br>
        Also, a price trend on cardmarket can sometimes be buggy. This complicates the decision process, seeing that we're stuck with a certain legal list for a main set release at a time.<br>
        So, we have to try to work around the bugs.<br>
        The list of legal cards is also not made manually since this would not be humanly doable. I developed a script that goes through all of the data and decides based on that data.
        This simply means that I've made certain assumptions about what this data - including the broken parts - realistically mean about the price trend.<br>
        Some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Early in development I tested if Sol Ring was legal (it shouldn't have been) and was surprised that it would be listed as legal.
            I noticed that cardmarket listed one of the versions of Sol Ring as a price trend of €0.02 even though its lowest price was €4.00.
            The price trend on cardmarket is not always accurate, sometimes it is simply bugged/broken. The €0.02 is the bug that happens most.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some cards also just have a weirdly low price trend sometimes. If a card has a price trend of €0.17 but its lowest price is €0.38, that price trend looks fishy for example.
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes, a price trend is missing in the data, or</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>How is price trend of a card decided?</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>The MTG price guide is downloaded from cardmarket and processed.</li>
          <li>The price trend of each version of a card is retrieved.</li>
          <li>Does the card-version not have a non-foil price trend? Then the price trend is the foil price trend of that card-version.</li>
          <li>Is the price trend of the card-version below €0.26 and is the lowest price of the card-version above €0.30? Then the price trend of the card-version is the lowest price. This is seen as the price trend being too inaccurate. The €0.05 cent margin of error is to not falsely flag high-volume cards around the €0.25 range that constantly sell out at the lower prices.</li>
          <li>Is instead the price trend of the card-version below €0.06 and is the lowest price of the card-version above €0.25? Then the price trend of the card-version is the lowest price. This is seen as the price trend being broken, often at €0.02.</li>
          <li>Does the card-version have no available price trend data or foil price trend data? Then the card-version is not considered anymore.</li>
        </ol>
        For the price trends of versions of commander cards the process is the same, but point 4 and 5 have different price cutoffs for broken data detection:
        <ol start="4">
          <li>Is the price trend of the card-version below €1.01 and is the lowest price of the card-version above €1.10? Then the price trend of the card-version is the lowest price. This is seen as the price trend being too inaccurate.</li>
          <li>Is instead the price trend of the card-version below €0.20 and is the lowest price of the card-version above €1.00? Then the price trend of the card-version is the lowest price. This is seen as the price trend being broken, often at €0.02.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h2>How is the legality of a card decided?</h2>
      <p>
        For the cards in the 99:<br>
        If at least one card-version of a card has a decided price trend of €0.25 or lower, it is quarters legal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the cards as commander:<br>
        If at least one card-version of a commander card has a decided price trend of €1.00 or lower, it is quarters legal.
      </p>

      <h2>Exceptions</h2>
      <p>
        Current exceptions that are <u>legal</u>:
        <ul>
          <li>Wastes - has a non-legal price trend on cardmarket, but it is a basic land.</li>
        </ul>
