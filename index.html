      <h2>What is the Quarters format?</h2>
      <p>
        Quarters is a budget variant of the MTG commander format.<br>
        The format was originally made in the US by the creators of <a href="https://www.mtgquarters.com/" target="_blank">mtgquarters.com</a>.<br>
        This is the EU version of the format, since <a href="https://www.cardmarket.com/" target="_blank">cardmarket.com</a> is the main price indicator here.
      </p>
      <p>
        In quarters, all cards in the 99 have a price trend of €0.25 or less according to <a href="https://www.cardmarket.com/" target="_blank">cardmarket.com</a>.<br>
        Your commander has a price trend of €1.00 or less.<br>
        Of course, all basic lands - including wastes - are legal.
      </p>
      <p>The legal list is recalculated one week after the official release of each main set</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>How many cards are legal in quarters?</b><br>
          Despite the price restriction, roughly 19.300 cards out of 29.000 total EDH-legal cards are legal in quarters for the 99.<br>
          About 1600 cards are legal as a commander, out of roughly 2300 total possible commanders in EDH.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>When do cards rotate in/out?</b><br>
          One week after the official release of each main set.<br>
          At that time, we download the price and product lists from Cardmarket that contains all of the cards with their versions/reprints and their price trend.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>When is a card legal in quarters?</b><br>
          When a card has at least one version that has a price trend less than or equal to €0.25, the card (and all of its versions) is legal in quarters.<br>
          When at least one version of an EDH-legal commander card is less than or equal to €1.00, it is legal as a commander.<br>
          <u>Of course, only cards that are already legal in the regular commander format can be legal in quarters.</u><br>
          However, the price trend of an item on Cardmarket can sometimes be bugged. This means that the full details are a bit more complicated.<br>

        <li>
          <b>Can I play an expensive print of a quarters-legal card?</b><br>
          Yes, all versions of a card are legal as long as one version of the card is legal.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Why play quarters instead of just regular commander?</b><br>
          Quarters is certainly not meant as a replacement for commander, but as another choice you can make with your friends.<br>
          Opinion: I think the price restriction has some benefits.
          <ul>
            <li>The format is very budget friendly, since each deck basically costs €25.75 or less.</li>
            <li>It keeps the price level at a table very similar. You don't have to worry about someone in your pod suddenly rocking up with a 200 dollar card.</li>
            <li>Making a thematic or funny deck whose primary focus isn't on being good is viable, since you don't have to spend more than €25 on it.</li>
            <li>You might already have a lot of the cards you need for a deck in your bulk.</li>
